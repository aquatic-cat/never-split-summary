        <h1>Never Split the Difference</h1>
        <h2>Summary & Key Principles</h2>
        <p>"Never Split the Difference" by Chris Voss is a deep dive into high-stakes negotiations, blending FBI hostage negotiation techniques with business and everyday applications.</p>
        
        <div class="principle">
            <h3>Tactical Empathy</h3>
            <p>Understanding and acknowledging the emotions of others to create trust and influence outcomes.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="principle">
            <h3>Mirroring</h3>
            <p>Subtly repeating the last few words someone says to encourage them to reveal more information.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="principle">
            <h3>Labeling</h3>
            <p>Identifying and verbalizing emotions to defuse tension and build rapport.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="principle">
            <h3>No-Oriented Questions</h3>
            <p>Asking questions that prompt a "No" response to make the other person feel in control.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="principle">
            <h3>Finding the Black Swan</h3>
            <p>Uncovering hidden motivations or unknown factors that can shift a negotiation in your favor.</p>

        <h2>Real-Life Stories from the Book</h2>
        
        <div class="story">
            <h3>The Chase Manhattan Bank Robbery</h3>
            <p>Chris Voss and his team were called in to handle a bank robbery with hostages. Instead of demanding the robbers surrender, Voss used tactical empathy by acknowledging their fear and uncertainty. By labeling their emotions—"It sounds like you're feeling trapped"—he built rapport. Eventually, this led to a peaceful resolution with no loss of life.</p>
            <strong>Why it worked:</strong> Acknowledging emotions reduced tension and created a cooperative atmosphere.
            <p><strong>What could have gone wrong?</strong> A direct order to surrender could have escalated the situation to violence.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="story">
            <h3>The Kidnapping in Haiti</h3>
            <p>When an American was kidnapped in Haiti, Voss's team negotiated with the kidnappers. Instead of panicking, they used mirroring. When the kidnappers demanded a ransom of $150,000, Voss calmly repeated, "$150,000?" This forced the kidnappers to justify their price, giving away key information. Through continued mirroring and strategic pauses, the ransom was reduced to $5,000, and the hostage was released safely.</p>
            <strong>Why it worked:</strong> Mirroring encouraged the other party to reveal more, allowing negotiators to gain control.
            <p><strong>What could have gone wrong?</strong> Accepting the initial demand at face value would have cost far more.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="story">
            <h3>Business Deal Saved by Labeling</h3>
            <p>In a corporate negotiation, a CEO sensed hesitation from the other party. Instead of pushing harder, he labeled their concerns: "It seems like something’s holding you back." This led them to reveal an unspoken fear about delivery timelines. By addressing this openly, they were able to secure the deal.</p>
            <strong>Why it worked:</strong> Labeling allowed the negotiator to surface hidden concerns and resolve them.
            <p><strong>What could have gone wrong?</strong> Without labeling, the deal might have fallen apart due to unspoken fears.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="story">
            <h3>Salary Negotiation with No-Oriented Questions</h3>
            <p>Instead of saying, "Can I get a raise?" a negotiator asked, "Would it be crazy to discuss a higher salary given my contributions?" This made the employer feel in control and more open to negotiation. The result? A significant salary increase.</p>
            <strong>Why it worked:</strong> The question gave the other party a sense of control, making them more likely to engage in the discussion.
            <p><strong>What could have gone wrong?</strong> A direct ask might have led to a flat-out rejection.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="story">
            <h3>Finding the Black Swan in a Hostage Crisis</h3>
            <p>In a particularly tense hostage situation, Voss discovered that one of the captors had a deep respect for his mother. Using this information, he convinced the captor that his actions would shame his family. This unexpected angle led to the safe release of the hostages.</p>
            <strong>Why it worked:</strong> Identifying the captor’s hidden motivator shifted the power dynamics.
            <p><strong>What could have gone wrong?</strong> Without uncovering the captor’s personal values, persuasion would have been much harder.</p>
